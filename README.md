# Demo Project

I wanted to do some A/B testing for a casual project but couldn't up with a good name for it.
Since I'm not an expert in this domain, I wanted to run it by you once.

Sadly I can't introduce blinds in this testing - the subject knows that they are being experimented upon.

You have two paths - Choose your path wisely as you submit to being a guinea pig to my nefarious means -

- [Path 1](path1.html) 
- [Path 2](path2.html)
